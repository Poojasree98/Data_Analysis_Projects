# RFM Analysis

RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour.

RFM stands for Recency (the date they made their last purchase), Frequency (how often they make purchases) and Monetary value (the amount spent on purchases), which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty and value to a business.
